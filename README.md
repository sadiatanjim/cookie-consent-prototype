# cookie-consent-prototype
A front-end prototype demonstrating cookie consent functionality, developed using semantic HTML, custom CSS, and core JavaScript for DOM manipulation and event handling.
This cookie consent prototype reinforces practical front-end development skills, particularly in DOM manipulation, form handling, and dynamic UI behavior.

### Key Concepts & Skills Demonstrated:

  * Implementing asynchronous behavior with setTimeout()
  * Manipulating the DOM dynamically using element.style
  * Handling user input via forms with FormData and the .get() method
  * Controlling default browser actions using event.preventDefault()
  * Applying modern CSS techniques such as flex-direction: row-reverse and class toggling for layout and interaction
  * Managing UI states effectively with the 'disabled' attribute
